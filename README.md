## âœ¨ What We've Built So Far  

### ðŸŽ­ Deep Class System  

Four distinct playable classes, each with unique mechanics and detailed progression paths :  

- **Warrior** â€“ Frontline melee fighter using *Momentum*. Evolves into defensive **Vanguards**, frenzied **Berserkers**, or battlefield-controlling **Wardens**.  
- **Necromancer** â€“ Master of death magic & summoning, using *Soul Energy* to raise minions and spread decay.  
- **Rogue** â€“ Agile, evasive, and precise damage dealer, using *Energy* for stealth, critical strikes, or traps.  
- **Mage** â€“ Ranged magic damage dealer and battlefield manipulator, using *Mana* to unleash elemental, illusory, or time-based powers.  

**Class Features:**  
- Multi-Stage Evolution â€“ Named tiers at key level milestones (e.g., *Warrior â†’ Vanguard â†’ Knight â†’ Paladin*).  
- Unique Resources & Mechanics â€“ Each class has its own resource with specific gain/spend rules.  
- Skills & Traits â€“ Every evolution grants new active abilities and passive bonuses.  
- Lore-Rich Progression â€“ Narrative flavor for each stage.  
- Ascended Forms & Hidden Paths â€“ Legendary evolutions like *The Hollow King, Deathlord Eternal*, etc.

### âš” Foundational Combat System  

Turn-based combat with speed-based turn order and room-based enemy encounters.  

**Key Features:**  
- **Turn Order** â€“ Based on Speed (*SPD*).  
- **Enemy Encounters** â€“ Triggered per room; player can choose to engage.  
- **Basic Attacks** â€“ All combatants have a fallback attack.  
- **Resource Management** â€“ Spend class resources; feedback if insufficient.  
- **Minion System** â€“ Summons join turn order.  
- **Victory/Defeat Conditions** â€“ Win when enemies die, lose at 0 HP.  

**Skill Examples (Necromancer):**  
- *Grave Bolt* â€“ Damage scaling with corpses.  
- *Raise Skeleton* â€“ Summon a minion with its own turns.  
- *Soul Leech* â€“ Damage + healing.  
- *Channel the Grave* â€“ 0-cost safety valve to gain Soul Energy.

### ðŸ’¬ Enhanced User Experience  

Features aimed at accessibility and immersion:  

- **Typing Effect** â€“ Retro-style gradual text display.  
- **Separate Class Lore View** â€“ Access via `class_lore` (`cl`).  
- **Flexible Command Parser:**  
  - Accepts aliases (e.g., `gb` for *Grave Bolt*).  
  - Handles extra spaces & varied formats (`use grave bolt #1`, `attack@2`).  
  - Auto-targeting when thereâ€™s only one valid target.  
  - Fuzzy Matching for skill names.  
- **Contextual Error Messages** â€“ Show status, valid targets, and tips when a command fails.
